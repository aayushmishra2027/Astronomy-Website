            <h2>Black Holes</h2>
            <div id="blackhole-3d" class="three-d-container"></div>
            <p>A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from it. They form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycles. The boundary surrounding a black hole is called the event horizon, beyond which nothing can return.</p>
            <p>Black holes can be classified into different types based on their size and mass:</p>
            <ul>
           <li><strong>Stellar Black Holes:</strong> Formed from the remnants of massive stars after they explode in supernovae. These black holes have masses up to 20 times that of our Sun.</li>
           <li><strong>Supermassive Black Holes:</strong> Found at the centers of galaxies, including our Milky Way, these black holes have masses ranging from millions to billions of times that of the Sun.</li>
           <li><strong>Intermediate Black Holes:</strong> These are black holes with masses between stellar and supermassive black holes, but their existence is still a topic of research and debate.</li>
           <li><strong>Primordial Black Holes:</strong> Hypothetical black holes that may have formed soon after the Big Bang, with masses ranging from very small to very large.</li>
           </ul>

            <h2>Neutron Stars</h2>
            <div id="neutronstar-3d" class="three-d-container"></div>
            <p>Neutron Stars are the collapsed cores of massive stars. They are incredibly dense and have strong magnetic fields. Neutron stars are only about 20 kilometers in diameter but have a mass about 1.4 times that of the sun. Their density is so immense that a sugar-cube-sized amount of neutron-star material would weigh about a billion tons on Earth.</p>
